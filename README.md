## What is ReadmeReady?

Automated documentation of programming source code is a challenging task with significant practical and scientific implications for the developer community. ReadmeReady is a large language model (LLM)-based application that developers can use as a support tool to generate basic documentation for any publicly available repository. Over the last decade, several research have been done on generating documentation for source code using neural network architectures. With the recent advancements in LLM technology, some open-source applications have been developed to address this problem. However, these applications typically rely on the OpenAI APIs, which incur substantial financial costs, particularly for large repositories. Moreover, none of these open-source applications offer a fine-tuned model or features to enable users to fine-tune. Additionally, finding suitable data for fine-tuning is often challenging. Our application addresses these issues.

## Installation
### Install it from PyPI

The simplest way to install ReadmeReady and its dependencies is from PyPI with pip, Python's preferred package installer.

```bash
pip install doc_generator
```

In order to upgrade ReadmeReady to the latest version, use pip as follows.

```bash
$ pip install -U doc_generator
```

### Install it from source

You can also install ReadmeReady from source as follows.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/souradipp76/ReadMeReady.git
$ cd ReadMeReady
$ make install
```

To create a virtual environment before installing ReadmeReady, you can use the command:
```bash
$ make virtualenv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Usage

### Initialize
```bash
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
$ export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN>
```

### Command-Line

```bash
$ python -m doc_generator
#or
$ doc_generator
```

### In Code

```py
from doc_generator import query
from doc_generator import index

repo_config = {
