    "# Fine-Tuning with Llama 2, Bits and Bytes, and QLoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we'll explore fine-tuning the Llama 2 model available using QLoRA, Bits and Bytes, and PEFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "- QLoRA: [Quantized Low Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14314.pdf) - this is a method for fine-tuning LLMs that uses a small number of quantized, updateable parameters to limit the complexity of training. This technique also allows those small sets of parameters to be added efficiently into the model itself, which means you can do fine-tuning on lots of data sets, potentially, and swap these \"adapters\" into your model when necessary.\n",
    "- [Bits and Bytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes): An excellent package by Tim Dettmers et al., which provides a lightweight wrapper around custom CUDA functions that make LLMs go faster - optimizers, matrix mults, and quantization. In this notebook we'll be using the library to load our model as efficiently as possible.\n",
    "- [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft): An excellent Huggingface library that enables a number Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, which again make it less expensive to fine-tune LLMs - especially on more lightweight hardware like that present in Kaggle notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many thanks to [Bojan Tunguz](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz) for his excellent [Jeopardy dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/200000-jeopardy-questions)!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on [an excellent example from LangChain](https://github.com/asokraju/LangChainDatasetForge/blob/main/Finetuning_Falcon_7b.ipynb)."

    "Note that we're loading very specific versions of these libraries. Dependencies in this space can be quite difficult to untangle, and simply taking the latest version of each library can lead to conflicting version requirements. It's a good idea to take note of which versions work for your particular use case, and `pip install` them directly."
